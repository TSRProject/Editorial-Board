# FRAMEWORK FOR CHANGE for the cities
The approach for the building of an ontology starts looking at the #frameworkforchange.
In the framework for change we can read about some **actions/milestones that happen** in an environment:
- recoinnassaince
- maintanance
- design
- visioning
- cooperation
- communication
- assessment

The **actors** in this environment are:
- [WHAT] => OBJECTIVES
- [WHO] => PEOPLE
- [HOW] => PRACTICES
- [WHERE] => PLACES


The **variables** in this environment are:
- Expectations
- Languages
- Time
- Procedures
