# Editorial-Curation
This is the repository for the editorial curation of the [ontology-on-the-making](https://tsrproject.github.io/TSROnto/)


# TO DO
Given the best practices, we can say that we need:
- taxonomy
- thesauri
- and then ontology

Other to do
actors - behaviours - activities => main attributes and sub attributes

# FAQ PAGE

**What is a knowledge base?** An ontological knowledge base is a machine-readable knowledge base with a formal semantic model.
Why do we talk about databases? We use databases for a way of conveying information.
There are two main types of databases, i.e. the machine-readable one and the human readable one; namely, the archive (structured information) and the document (unstructured information).

NB: Ontology describes a domain, while a knowledge base (based on an ontology) describes particular state of affairs. Each knowledge based system or agent has its own knowledge base, and only what can be expressed using an ontology can be stored and used in the knowledge base.

# FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
1) Glossary for the website



# COMPETENCY QUESTIONS
1. What are the requirement for the change to happen?
2. What are the prerequisited to make the change to happen?


# PAIN POINTS
1. How do we configure change?
2. What is change?
3. Are we considering a quantitative or qualitative change?



# AN OPEN ONTOLOGY
- coordination cross-boundaries: a lot of interoperability



# TOOLS
An ontology editing system is an artifact editing system that can solve an Ontology Engineering Task.

AKA: Ontology Modeling System, Ontology Editor, Ontology Editor System, Ontology Design.

We're going to use **Protégé**
