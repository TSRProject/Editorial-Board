# ontology process planning. fase 0
talking about misurable goals, the first thing in the plan is to support the research questions about the why of developing an ontology. So the start regards a stackeholder map to identify key actions that the ontology needs to support.

# fase 1: tutto cio che riguarda l ontology development
1. the domain: co-design practices for change
co-design: implica già la presenza di attori come cittadini, professionisti e stackeholders interacting in a precise environment. A proposito di ciò, sarebbe bello fare una piccola parentesi sui vari tools e metodologie utilizzati in vari contesti (dalle enterprises, ai ruangrupa in documenta per esempio).

to search for existing ontologies in this domain, we searched for them in:

    http://wiki.DBPedia.org
    http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/Protege_Ontology_Library
    http://semanticweb.org/wiki/Ontology.html
    https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology
    http://ontologydesignpatterns.org
    http://schema.org/  

We decided to identify the most peculiar aspects from each different ontology that resulted useful to take into consideraiton, in alignment with our vision.
NB: not all ontologies taken into consideration are striclty related to codesign practices for change, both because they are quite inexistent both because it is vital to be contaminated by every part of design thinking and practice materials.

# future developments. the development of an ontology will be helpful to facilitate our job, for example, by building user friendly interfaces to deal with maps and text, also by allowing users to label things. Furthermore it can be a base to build interactive applications and so on.


# the ethical discourse
mettere anche un paragrafo sul perché oarliamo di semantic web e le derive della taxonomy wave: questioni etiche come il potere e il consenso.

#ontology and knowledge graphs in a common sense: the glossary
class = entity, thing, sometimes subject
semantic domain = field of a certain discipline, for example the field of design, the category of co-design practices for change making
attribures = properties. nb: only entities can have attributes
edge = relationship, the verb in a sentence
metti diagramma se te lo fa mettere sparql is a query language
